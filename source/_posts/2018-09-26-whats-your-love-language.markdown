So, This is really a new way of talking, isn’t it! Dr. Gary Chapman coined the term love language to express how we express and receive love. So, it is not only based for romantic partner, but you can also identify what works for you at a usual basis. We have been hearing that a male’s and a female’s brain is different, but this is something where it is only about the type of love language that suits you.

So, let us go through the five types of Love Languages , so that you can also identify which is a good fit for you .

#### How to communicate:
Put down your phone and other things that mostly distract you. Focus on uninterrupted interaction or discussion. One on one time is very critical. You must have heard something called as “Me Time”, there has to be an “Our Time” also. 

#### Actions to take:
Create special moments together like scheduling and going for a walk together, doing or indulging in some activities with your spouse, going for a weekend getaways or even travelling somewhere close by.

#### Things to avoid:
Having distractions like Mobile apps, games, chatting with someone else, long stint without spending time with each other. 

### 2) Physical Touch
Physical touch is showing love through hugging, cuddling, being intimate or simply putting a caring hand on someone’s shoulder. Sometimes, your partner might be more physically active than you. Even if you don’t like it, you should indulge or try to be in it happily, because that is one way of making your partner happy.
