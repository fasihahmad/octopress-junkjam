Even though you cannot control how a girl feels about you, nor can you make her fall in love with yourself but there is certainly something that you can do to put yourself in a better zone. Here are some tips that would help you impress a girl:
#Compliment her sincerely 
Whenever you are around a girl, you should give her a sincerely genuine compliment. The best way of doing this is think of her best quality (do not go on her physical attributes) and compliment her semi-privately. In short, you do not need to have her completely alone or in presence of her friends and your friends overhearing the conversation. This could be offensive in her eyes.
#Approach her politely
Being well-mannered can indeed be a very good quality and would help you greatly and this is that one trait that girls want in their guys. Try to show her that you can also be considerate by being polite not only to her but to everyone. 
#Think before you speak or act
When you are around the girl you want to impress, try and be choosy about your words. Take a few seconds to evaluate what are you exactly going to say before you actually say it out. Also, do not try things like making her jealous by talking about other girls.  
#Dress to impress
Well, I won’t tell you to be a perfect gentleman but when you take care of your grooming, it would make her feel that you are mature as well as capable of important daily tasks. Moreover, if you just notice the style of clothes she puts on, and you also wear the same style, this will relate her with you and she will start finding you attractive.

#Be a little humorous 
There is no harm in being a little humorous but make sure you do not go out of your limits. Narrate some of the light and funny things that have happened in your life but be sure that your supply is just right extra beneath.
#Be a good listener
Whenever you sit and talk to that girl, just make sure that you listen to what she is saying. Girls are more likely to get attracted towards guys who listen to every inch of talk that they do. Moreover, being a good listener is always a good quality that would help you attract people towards you.
