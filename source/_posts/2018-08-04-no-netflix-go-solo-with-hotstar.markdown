When the world around is bragging about Netflix and its series, not having Netflix subscription should not feel like the end of the world. Here is list of things that you could watch on Hotstar without burning any hole in the pocket and can have fun, laughter riots and sense of nostalgia with a visit of serials that you used to watch in Childhood.

Here is a package of serials that can keep you engaged and entertained this weekend:

#### 1.  AIB (All India Bakchod):

YES! That group of boys, who roasted Arjun Kapoor and Ranveer Singh along with the whole bollywood troop, is available on Hotstar. This is a Hotstar Originals where they have used all the ongoing social and political issues in a humorous way. 

*Warning:* Use earplugs, these boys have rich vocabulary when it comes to slang and they donâ€™t leave a single chance to show off it!!

#### 2.  Sarabhai Vs Sarabhai:

That conflict of middle-class Monisha and the nok jhok among Sarabhais is quite a thing to re-visit. This entire series takes you down to the memory lane when you could sit and laugh without fearing of any scene of obscenity. 
Only Hotstar has got the new season along with the retro one, so do not miss out!

#### 3.  Khichdi:

Ok! So we are the millennial who grew up with this much of awesomeness and Khichdi just added some more bright colors to it. The couple of doubtful Hansa and Genius Praful and the whole Gujrati family welcome you in their world of illogical yet entertaining conversation. The dialogues is going to linger in your mind for a while, right now in my mind is Praful...Tu to gadha hai!!
Again, Hotstar has got the latest and the oldest one.

#### 4.  Dill Mill Gayye:

Well.. talk of the town and a trend setter of its time. The romantic drama weaved around a hospital tale with set of hot actors and their sizzling chemistry. It deserves a walk. May be, you can get some romance inspo or best pick up lines.

#### 5.  Pyar ki ye ek kahani:

The saga of love among human,vampire and wolf or say Indian version of Vampire Diaries. The serial that took us to the fantasy world and made us google if vampires really exist! Another excuse to watch this serial is the chemistry of Piashree and Vivian Dsena, and simultaneous love triangle of college students.

Go on a solo rewind mode with Hotstar this weekend when the crowd around is doing Netflix and chill!!
