Solang Valley
Located 15kms above Manali lies Solang valley. At this place, one can find adventures in tranquillity. Solang valley, indeed, is dangerously beautiful with lots of ups and downs. This place comes on the way to Rohtang pass and like the state itself, this place is love for people who have visited for adventure, trekking or just to feel stillness of the nature. Let it be summer season or winter weather, it is a perfect sight to see..!!

It is beautiful and it can be defined in this way:

### Sports:
Steep slope of Solang valley makes it perfect for Skiing, but this facility is offered in winter only.

Skiing is replaced by Zorbing in summer- It starts somewhere from the month of May. Zorbing, if you have no idea about, is an adventure activity done in the steep slopes. It is done in huge ball with capacity of 2 people to go inside and it is rolled down from hills with distance of 200 meters.

Paragliding, well personally I would define it as watching hills while flying like bird. It is one hell of an experience, moment of adrenaline rush mixed with excitement of flying.

Lately, cable car has been introduced which will carry people to the height of 2200 meters allowing them to glide from there.
There is provision of Rope crossings as there is water flowing amid the rocks and Bungee Jumping too.

A night stay in camp is always in the plan of travellers. Well, Solang Valley will not leave you disappointed in this arena too. The valley becomes too silent at night left with only few tourist and workers over there.
Though the number of camps above are too less, you can do booking before reaching or you can directly go and book, depending on the season.

Hotels, too, are available.
