The Maldives is largely water, with over 1000 little islands. Most islands are uninhabited, and those with people just contain a couple of resorts on the whole island. This implies that there won’t be too many people. Some of the islands just have a couple of villas, which means that the whole island will probably have less than ten couples on it at one time. It's considerably more enjoyable to appreciate the shoreline when there are fewer people. 

#### 3. Diving and Snorkeling
