## 1. Janpath: 
This is among one of the most famous street markets of Delhi located in Connaught Place. Not only Indians but you can also find many foreign tourists shopping here. Youngsters love to shop from Janpath Market as it’s affordable and offers variety at the same time. Girls can get trendy accessories like neckpieces, earrings, and bracelets only for Rs. 30. On Sundays it’s very crowded as it’s the Sale Time where you can find amazing tops, dresses, bags at just Rs. 100 to Rs. 200. Janpath Market is also known for the handicraft items like Punjabi juttis, hand embroidered kurtis, jute bags etc. One thing you need to be very careful about is bargaining because there is no limit for that. The more you bargain, the more affordable shopping you can do!

## 2. Sarojini Nagar Market: 
Located in the South Delhi, Sarojini Nagar is bliss for all the young college and office going girls. Whether you want a trendy dress for a party, regular wear or formals, you can get the best here at very affordable prices. Apart from clothes, here you can also find branded cosmetic products like Lakme Eyeconic Kajal, Lakme 9 t 5 Eyeliner, Lipsticks etc at very cheap prices. The packing of these cosmetic products looks very similar to the original ones but still it’s not confirmed whether they are original or duplicate, all the vendors say that they get it from custom and that’s why they sell it at cheap prices. No matter they are duplicate or original but still girls crazily buy them and come again and again to buy them, so we can say that the quality must be good. Here you can also find quite inexpensive sunglasses, stoles, perfumes, trendy jewelry, footwear, bags etc. But you have to be a bargaining expert while shopping from this market as shopkeepers say any random price which might be double or triple the actual sale price of the product.

## 3. Chandni Chowk: 
One of the oldest and still most popular markets of Delhi is Chandni Chowk. This place is perfect if you want to go for bulk wedding shopping. Here you can find all types of Indian Ethnic Dresses like Lehenga Coli, Indo Western Gowns, Sarees, Salwar Kameez, Kurtis etc. The market is also very popular for Indian Jewellery like necklace, bangles, pearls, mang tika etc. What makes Chandni Chowk the most popular choice of even the Bollywood stars is the variety of Paranthas that is served at Paranthe wali Gali. Some of the bollywood movies like Chandni Chowk to China, Dilli 6 etc. have also been shot in Chandni Chowk. The only thing that is a big turn down about the Chandni Chowk’s market is that it’s too crowded.
