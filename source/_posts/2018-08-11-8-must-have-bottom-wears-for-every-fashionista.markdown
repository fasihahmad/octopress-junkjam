#### 1.  Palazzos
The key to looking stylish in palazzos is to feel comfy wearing them, which is exactly what palazzos are all about - comfortable and fashionable. Palazzos are stylish and cool summer-wear and give women a much-needed break from the dull blue jeans, dresses, normal work pants and salwar kameez. Palazzos have become a rage in India; it is the most loved Indo-western trend adopted from the flared silhouettes of the 60s and 70s.
