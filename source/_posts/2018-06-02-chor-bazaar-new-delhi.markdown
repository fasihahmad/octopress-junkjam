If you are brand freak, you have to shuffle through all the stuffs and find out the one with the real tag. You can find plenty of second hand things, and most of them are branded and stolen.
Choose your domain, Lucky or unlucky! But you may find some of your stolen stuff ;)


#### Keep in Mind
-  Make sure you wear comfortable clothes to roam around freely.
-  Polish your bargaining skills.
-  Re-check the stuffs for any kind of damage before paying.
-  If you are on shopping spree, carry a bag along.
-  Take care of your bag/wallet/purse.
-  Use Public transport for no parking hassle.

#### What else?
The Delhi market will never disappoint you for food, head to chandhni chowk for the delicious breakfast. Start from Jalebi wala, one of the oldest shops in the loacality, and taste those finger licking Rabri-jalebi. Perfect start for Sunday! Later you could go to the Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib for some blessing, in case you are religious.

#### Timing & How to reach:
The market starts setting up from 5:00 am in the morning and remains there by 11:00 am. Early you reach, more stuff you collect.

Take any metro to Jama Masjid metro station, prefer the violet line. Exit from the gate number 2  and you will find yourself surrounded by the stalls.
