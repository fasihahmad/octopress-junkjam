Bollywood has always shown gay members in a ridicule-worthy way. The main motive was to add an extra zing of comedy to the movie. They are never shown as the accepted members of the society. However here are few progressive bollywood films where the actor has convincingly played the role of a gay person. Kudos to the bollywood directors for initiating and presenting the following beautiful movies about LGBT community.

The film was praised because it has taken up adolescent issues of sexuality and personal life choices. The friendliness, sociability,  laughter and the bond between two brothers is tested when a 14-year-old boy is confronted with the complexities of a simple relationship.

Now that section 377 has been scrapped, maybe we can find more such movies. We need movies that are sensitive and more realistic towards the LGBT community. Not to mention above movies have faced their share of criticism and were condemn in certain parts. Though there were parts in movie that failed in refinement and were not able to break the stereotype but we shall be overwhelmed and honoured by each and every member of the film who took / will take a step towards gay rights and for creating awareness among every citizen of India.
